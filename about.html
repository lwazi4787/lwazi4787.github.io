				<h1>Life into software development</h1><br>
				<p>I’m a 22 year old male software developer from Durban South Africa. I was introduced to software development when I was in varsity but I always aspired to learn it prayer to that. I did computer science in University of KwaZulu-Natal 2014 where I was introduced to the concepts of software development via the java language. I dropped out of varsity before my first year ended because I also had ambitions of learning about computer hardware architecture as well.</p> <br>

				<p>I than started doing computer systems engineering at Mangosuthu University of Technology where both my learning ambitions where satisfied. I was re-introduced to the concepts of software engineering via C++ this time alongside other computer hardware fundamentals, computer network concepts and fundamentals and electrical engineering and electronics concepts and fundamentals. I than further on dived dipper to software development by learning embedded system programming with c, microprocessor programming with assemble and web development  front end and back end with html, css, JavaScript and php. Finally I went back to java where I learned about GUI programming and object oriented programming where we touched on inheritance and polymorphism but to name a few. I did a voting web application for my final year design project and I always do projects back to back just for the fun of it. I just finished my academic studies now I’m trying to get an in-service training so I can graduate.</p>
